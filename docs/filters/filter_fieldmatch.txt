   field             <int>        ..FV....... set the field to match from (from -1 to 1) (default auto)
     auto            -1           ..FV....... automatic (same value as 'order')
     bottom          0            ..FV....... bottom field

   mchroma           <boolean>    ..FV....... set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons (default true)
   y0                <int>        ..FV....... define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between y0 and y1 from the field matching decision (from 0 to INT_MAX) (default 0)
   y1                <int>        ..FV....... define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between y0 and y1 from the field matching decision (from 0 to INT_MAX) (default 0)
   scthresh          <double>     ..FV....... set scene change detection threshold (from 0 to 100) (default 12)
   combmatch         <int>        ..FV....... set combmatching mode (from 0 to 2) (default sc)
     none            0            ..FV....... disable combmatching
     sc              1            ..FV....... enable combmatching only on scene change
     full            2            ..FV....... enable combmatching all the time
   combdbg           <int>        ..FV....... enable comb debug (from 0 to 2) (default none)
     none            0            ..FV....... no forced calculation
     pcn             1            ..FV....... calculate p/c/n
